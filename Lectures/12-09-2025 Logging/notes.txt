Logging

5 - Trace/Diagnostics logs
    EVERYTHING - entered a method, exited method, parameters sent to a method, return values

4 - Debug
    Where do you think your code MIGHT fail?

3 - Information
    Something just happened. A user was created in the database, a controller finished running, a background queue was processed.

2 - Warning
    Something MIGHT go wrong, could turn into a problem

1 - Error
    An actual problem, shows up as an exception being thrown

0 - Critical
    Probably the server won't even boot up

-1 - Failure Audit
    Someone tried to login that wasn't authorized

We use numbers to easily filter as "more important than Information for example, i.e. all warnings and errors"

Logging Cost

1. Storage
    How long do we store logs for?
        30 days is typical for most logs, longer for warnings and higher

2. CPU
    Logging can be fire and forget (in async cases)
    Disable expensive logging in normal situations

    if (Logging.IsDebug()) {
        SomeExpensiveLogCalculation();
    }


What should we log?
    PII
        user-id -> guid, email address, ssn
        username
        ip-address
        address (location)

    Data center name, or node (CPU/machine) id

    Timings
        Start/Stop time of Requests
        Boot time of the server itself
        Time of external requests to queues, other services, databases, etc.

    Date/Time of the Request/Worker process

    Errors
        Stack trace, files that were missing, etc.

    HTTP/REST
        Method/Action (POST, PUT, GET, etc.)
        Headers
            Almost all headers are fair game to log, but NOT certs, authorization tokens, etc.
        URL
            path
            address
            query string parameters (i.e. api-version)

            NOT the SAS part of the URL


Answer:
    1. For all seven severity levels, come up with an example that you would log from one of the assignments in this class

    2. False Negatives vs. False Positives - Which is worse and why?
